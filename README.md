# ☕ Java Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**! 🚀  
This repository is a collection of Java programs, exercises, and mini-projects that I am building while learning the Java programming language.  
It covers everything from the basics to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, and some real-world practice projects.
